# Data-Ninja.io
## The dojo for the ninja working with data.

These pages are a colleciton of ideas and solutions found when working with the Azure data platform (and related topics). 
<br><br>
The ninja idea originated when Fred-San and Tobi-San started the <a href="https://www.tsql-ninja.com" target="_blank">T-SQL Ninja blog</a>. It has evolved to now include more information bits about all the topics related to the data platform. 
<br><br>
This blog and all its contents are intended to be open source so if you want to contribute to this collection of information, just write a markdown file with your insights and create a pull request.
